## Footing Installation Steps

### Step 1: Inspect Site Location *Required
- Refer to Location Plan to locate exact position for sign installation
- Inspect location and look for obstructions
- If installation cannot be carried out, contact Axent on 1S3AXENT

### Step 2: Hole Placement for Footings *Required
- Determine positioning in relation to road
- Ensure sign faces appropriate direction

#### Visibility and Spacing Guidelines
| Road Speed | Distance from Fog Line | Visibility |
|------------|------------------------|------------|
| 60 kph     | 3m                     | 6m         |
| 80 kph     | 6m                     | 9m         |
| 100 kph    | 9m                     | 100m       |

### Step 3: Mark, Dig and Insert Footings
- Mark footing locations using line marking paint
- Footings should be 1200-1300mm apart
- Dig holes with adequate backfill space
- Allow 50-100mm of crushed rock under-fill

#### Foundation Schedule
| Exposure (Terrain Category) | Soil Type                   | Foundation Depth | Notes                                     |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Normal (TC3)                | Firm to stiff Clay          | 700 MM          | If rock encountered, can shorten by 200mm |
|                             | Loose to medium dense Sand  |                 | Contact Axent for approval                |
| Exposed (TC2)               | Firm to stiff Clay          | 900 MM          |                                            |
|                             | Loose to medium dense Sand  | 1100 MM         |                                            |

### Step 4: Insert Poles, Align & Backfill *Required
- Place poles into pre-cast footing sleeves
- Do NOT secure with grub screws (to be removed later for alignment)

## Pole and Footing Installation

### Installation Process
1. Use a spirit level to ensure that the poles and footings are level and properly spaced while backfilling.
2. Regularly check the level during this process.
3. Once the backfill is added and the required level is achieved, use the remaining concrete to complete the final fill.
4. Remove the poles to allow for the installation of the solar panels.

### Pole and Footing Details
| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Pole | NB8O Pole, Slides into sleeve (unfixed) to check alignment |
| Footing | Engineered Pre-cast concrete footing in hole, sitting on crushed rock base |
| Backfill | Backfill with compacted fill or concrete around pre-cast footer |
| Base | Compacted Crushed Rock (50mm-100mm) |

Note: YOUR FIRE RISK TODAY IS Engineered pre-cast concrete foundations.

## Solar Installation

### STEP 1: Panel Orientation & Fastening

#### Panel Orientation Requirements
- It is essential to orient all solar panels in a northward direction, regardless of the sign's position.
- Consult your Site Plan and use a compass to determine an accurate North point reference. (23)
- Ensure pole lengths fall within a range of 4.7m to 4.8m

#### Installation Procedure
1. Position one end of the pole on a sawhorse or support structure, allowing for an overhang of approximately 1 metre.
2. Carefully place the solar panel at the top of the pole.
3. Install the "U-bolts" as depicted in the diagram sequence.
4. Securely tighten the U-bolts.

#### Hardware and Cable Management
- Use the 1/2 inch socket set to securely tighten the M12 nuts, washers, and U-bolts to the poles.
- Use cable ties to fasten the solar panel lead/cable to the top "U-bolt" for proper cable management.

### Solar Panel Specifications
| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Panels | 2x 80 watts with backup battery unit packs |
| Positioning | Panels face North |
